# React + Tanstack Query + Apollo React Client + Graphql Codegen + TypeScript + Vite Pokemon example

App is made to minimalize unnecessary data fetching.

Some of the features can be better visible on Slow 3g network emulation.

I have used useQuery where possible to reflect on setting of searchParams etc.
Im using native AbortController so no unnecessary code.
