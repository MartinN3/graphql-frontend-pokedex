# React + Tanstack Query + Apollo React Client + Graphql Codegen + TypeScript + Vite Pokemon example

App is made to minimalize unnecessary data fetching and UI jumping.

Some of the features can be better visible on:
fast 3g network emulation
apollo cache debug tool

I have used useQuery where possible to reflect on setting of searchParams etc.
Using native AbortController to abort fetches.
